# Grootan-Mock-API

## Pattern of working
* I have created a mock API using <a href="https://beecptor.com">Beeceptor</a> which will return a list of users.
* I have created a dummy login and user registration page.
* In this , I have consumed the API(Mock API - which i was created) and got the list of users registered.
* After that,I displayed the records stored in API using HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP as UI.
* After Login using dummy email id and password it redirects to the dashboard page.
* In dashboard page,User records were displayed.
* when a user clicks on a particular record,he/she should be able to see the respective details of that user.
* While showing the details ,I also provided next and previous user in the list.
